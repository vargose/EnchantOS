ENCHANT is an extension board, designed to be used in combination with a Teensy 3.2, along with our corresponding software, to perform as a Lights and Sounds controller (aka soundboard), intended for props in general; while having all the features necessary for high quality Lightsaber props in particular. ENCHANT is designed on the premise of taking advantage of RGB LED strips and an intuitive, fun, and powerful Menu system.

Software is available in both source code form and as prebuilt, ready to upload, .hex files. A variety of prebuilt software options, such as the EnchantOS Lightsaber variation, allow ENCHANT to operate like a traditional prop board. More prebuilt software implementing complete props will be added over time. The source code is available for programmers to have complete control over implementing a custom prop.

EnchantOS is an open source library, and the source code complementary to the ENCHANT Board. EnchantOS is well modularized –  It consists of LiteFXOS, which is a collection of LED strip pattern algorithms, in addition to a few other peripheral modules for handling audio and interactions. While EnchantOS is designed for use with Teensy and the ENCHANT Board, LiteFXOS can be used to easily implement LED patterns on any Arduino compatible platform.

Dimension are approximately: 1.7 in (length) x .7 in (width) x .25 in (depth)

Assembly

Start by cutting VUSB/VIN pad on the back of the Teensy. DO NOT FORGET this step! (The Teensy will be directly powered by the 3.7-4.2V Li-Ion battery source. The 5V USB port will power the battery charger.)

Mount the both boards on a breadboard, leaving some pin open for solder.

Solder the holes not used to mount the 2 boards in place.

Consider leaving the Vin pin without solder, so a lead wire can be more easily soldered later.

Change the mounting holes as needed and complete soldering the rest of the pin holes.

Be sure to avoid excess solder with the pin holes in front of the SD card holder.

There are 2 internal holes that will be a bit tricky to solder.

Hold the 2 board stack in place using a PCB mount or helping hands. Contact the soldering iron to the pin hole on one side and press the solder in from the other.

The board assembled

The board assembled, choosing to leave the Vin and GND pins on the Teensy open for lead wires.
Upload the Software

Use the Teensy firmware flash utility to upload the firmware. The entirety of Teensy development tools can be downloaded from PJRC, or just download the flash utility here.

Select the hex file. Then, click the button on the Teensy to enter the bootloader, as the flash utility indicates. Press the program button on the flash utility to upload the program. Once that is done, click the reset button to reset the device.



Overview

EnchantOS Lightsaber Firmware 1.0.6 – A .hex file, ready to be uploaded with the Teensy loader.

Lightsaber SD Card Files – An example set of SD card files, including the following:

    3 sound fonts using the Enchant style naming convention
    1 sound font using the Classic style naming convention
    config.txt – An example config file with default settings

Operation

The software organizes interactions with the prop though an intuitive Menu system. The change Menu function (hold the power button) will cycle through the top level menu: Light FX Menu, Saber FX Menu, and Music Visualizer Menu. Pressing the Aux button within each Menu will act depending on the Menu e.g. The Aux button is used in the Light FX Menu to switch between different Light FX.
Button 	Light FX  	Saber FX  	Music Visualizer 	Power Off
Power Click 	Power On / Off 	Power On / Off 	Power On / Off 	Power On
Aux Click 	Pattern Option 	Blaster 	Next Song 	
Power Hold 	Next Menu 	Next Menu 	Next Menu 	
Aux Hold 	Next Pattern 		Next Pattern 	Next Font
Hibernate

The saber will enter a low power state after a period of inactivity, 1 minute by default. Pressing the red button switch will boot the saber. After taking a moment to boot, pressing the red button switch again will ignite the blade.
Sound Font

WAV files are accepted in 44.1kHz mono or stereo. Audacity can be used to convert the sampling frequency, as well as repair wav files with invalid headers.

It is recommended that any file edits, such as renaming, be done in directory other than the SD card; then copy what would be the entire contents of the SD card onto the SD card. This way Windows regenerates any metadata regarding Short File Names and directory contents.

3 fonts can be accessed on the SD card (this can be increased at a later software update). Up to 16 different .wav files can be mapped to 1 sound effect.

The software supports 2 different naming conventions for mapping sound fonts: Enchant Style and Classic Style.
Enchant Style

The contents of the SD card should appear as follows:

With Enchant Style, the name of each sound effect is the name of each subdirectory under the font directory.

“bank1” is the name of the font (This name can be changed in the config file). It subdirectories: “PowerOn”, “PowerOff”, etc, contain the wav files mapped to the function suggested by the name.
Classic Style (support will be implemented in a later update)

The contents of the SD card should appear as follows:

With Classic Style, the name of each sound effect is a prefix for each sound file. All files are saved in the directory of the font.

“bank3” is the name of the font (This name can be changed in the config file). “poweron.wav”, “clash1.wav”, etc, are mapped to the function suggested by the name.
SmoothSwing

Original description

SmoothSwing will use 2 addition sets of sound effects: “SwingA” and “SwingB”. If Enchant style is selected, they will be the name of subdirectories set to contain .wav files. E.g bank1/SwingA/anyname.wav

The brown wire is optional, but prefer for stability.
Buttons

The Lightsaber software will use 2 buttons: Power and Aux. They are mapped to the following pins:

    Teensy Pin 13 -> Power
    Teensy Pin 18 -> Aux

Connect one terminal of the button to the pin indicated and the other to BAT-.
Battery

It is very important to select a high drain battery (or 2 batteries in parallel providing the equivalent high drain), for reasons of maximizing blade brightness as well as stability during audio playback.

Connect the battery directly to both BAT+ pins when possible for additional stability. Use at least 26 gauge thickness wire.

USB battery charger note: The on board battery charger uses a safety timer of 1-5 hours. This is usually not an issue for a setup using a single 18650 battery. However, bringing a deeply depleted battery back to full charge, or to fully charge multiple batteries connected in parallel, will require the charger to be unplugged and plugged back in to reset the timer.

Unprotected battery note: Ideally a PCB protected high discharge battery should be used. However unprotected batteries will often offer better discharge ratings. It is okay to use an unprotected battery as long as precautions are taken so that the battery does not discharge below 3V. For example: The Enchant Prop FX board will stop functioning at some point after the battery voltage drops below 3.3V. This may happen before the board gives the instruction to turn the LEDs off, leaving the LEDs on, continuing to discharge the battery. It is important to recognize when this happens and manually unplug the blade to prevent continued discharge of the battery.

Kill Switch note: The software will utilize hibernate mode for minimal battery drain while the Prop is “off”, so a kill switch is not necessary for the usual use case.


Bluetooth Compatibility

Bluetooth connectivity is support through an add-on Bluetooth module from Adafruit and the Adafruit Bluefruit App (Android, iOS). Compatibility is built into the current software.

Pin Connections:

    Bluefruit TXO – Teensy Pin 0
    Bluefruit RXI – Teensy Pin 1
    Bluefruit VIN – Battery +
    Bluefruit GND – Battery –
    Bluefruit CTS – Battery –
    Bluefruit RTS – NC
    Bluefruit MOD – NC
    Bluefruit DFU – Battery –

Make sure the Bluefruit module switch is set to UART mode.
